// Pearl's prepare stage on the device: everything between "here is a nonce"
// and "here are two noised matrices the GEMM can eat".
//
// One attempt is:
//
//   1. generate A (m x k) and B^t (n x k) from the nonce
//   2. keyed-blake3 each into its Merkle root
//   3. fold the two roots into commitment_A and commitment_B
//   4. draw the noise from those commitments
//   5. apply it, producing A_noised (m x k) and B_noised (k x n)
//
// then noisy_gemm.cuh takes over. All five stay on the device and on one
// stream: step 3 is four hashes of a single block, which would be free on the
// host except that reading the roots back would force a synchronise per
// attempt.
//
// This stage is NOT cheap, which is worth stating plainly because the obvious
// estimate says it is. Measured on a 4090 at m=n=4096, k=2048 (see section 7
// of tests/test_pearl_prepare.cu), against a 1.05 ms GEMM:
//
//     generate A  0.027   hash A     0.124   noise draws  0.051
//     generate B  0.023   hash B^t   0.123   noise A      0.025
//     commitments 0.008                      noise B      0.121
//
// 0.50 ms, a 48% overhead. Hashing dominates, and the B noising is slow
// because it transposes.
//
// The fix is not a faster kernel, it is reading the derivation again:
//
//     commitment_B = blake3(job_key || salted B^t root)
//     commitment_A = blake3(commitment_B || salted A root)
//
// commitment_B does not depend on A. E_BL and E_BR are drawn from it, so if
// only A varies between attempts then B_noised is IDENTICAL every time -
// generating B, hashing it and noising it are once per JOB. Only A's chain and
// the PoW key recur, and A is still a free choice, so nothing is given up.
// That is 0.50 ms down to 0.196, and 42.2 to 52.6 M candidates/s.
//
// Shape then matters, and the obvious metric picks the wrong one. Hashing A
// grows as m*k and the GEMM as m*n*k, so overhead falls monotonically as the
// shape widens - but candidates per second does not (measured with the
// register-tiled kernel, section 7 of tests/test_pearl_prepare.cu):
//
//     4096x4096    32.1% overhead    83.5 M/s   115.7 TOPS
//     1024x16384   26.3%             87.4       115.8
//     2048x32768    7.5%            102.9       115.9
//     4096x32768    4.5%            106.6       116.8
//     4096x65536    1.9%             91.5        97.8
//
// The last row has the lowest overhead and is the slowest, because B^t at
// 128 MB stops being servable from L2 and the GEMM itself drops. So the shape
// is chosen on candidates per second, and 4096x32768 is the default here:
// about 180 MB of device memory, and past the point where more amortisation is
// worth anything.
//
// The one constraint all this imposes: the padded matrices must have a POWER
// OF TWO number of 1024-byte chunks, so the Merkle tree is perfectly balanced
// and the block-cooperative reduction below is exactly blake3's own tree. With
// k = 2048 that means m and n are powers of two, which costs nothing since the
